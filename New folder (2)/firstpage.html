<h1>WELCOME TO THE LAND OF DIVERSITY! "INDIA"</h1>
<hr>
<p><i><b>India has more than made an impact on the world</b>, and rightfully so. Our country is indeed abundantly rich with culture, history, talent, personality, and charisma. India has broken multiple world records, made cinematic history, and has some of the best food you could possibly find in the world. No doubt all countries come with their downsides. But today we’re only going to talk about the positive or interesting traits that constitute a part of India’s personality. I think that this includes our size, both in terms of area and population. The latter is still growing exponentially.
